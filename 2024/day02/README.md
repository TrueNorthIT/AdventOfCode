# Day 02

Joe gave me the idea of how to do Part 2. Took longer than it should have to parse the files, but am getting more comfortable with string and list manipulation in Java. In paticular the difference between List and ArrayList confused me.

List is just an interface, that ArrayList and LinkedList inherit from, and lacks useful methods on its own. Still unsure of the best practice to convert from ArrayList to List and vice versa, as some methods return or require a List object.
