## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent Calendar of coding puzzles, with a new challenge released every day from December 1st to December 12th. These puzzles are designed to hone your problem-solving abilities and provide an excellent opportunity to learn new coding techniques.

## How to Get Started

1. **Sign Up**  
   Visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/) and sign up.

2. **Join the Private Leaderboard**  
   Go tho the [Leaderboard page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private) and Enter our private leaderboard code: **353270-4499e43b**
