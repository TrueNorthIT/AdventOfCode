# Welcome to Your Personal Advent of Code Branch ðŸŽ„

This is **your personal branch** for Advent of Code! Please use this branch to add your code, solutions, and any notes for the daily challenges.

## Guidelines for Using This Branch

1. **Structure Your Solutions**:
   - Each day's solution should be in a folder named `dayXX` (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.). These have already been created for you. 
   - There is a `README.md` in each `dayXX` folder. Feel free to use this to doccument, make note's etc. 

2. **Submitting to Advent of Code**:
   - Before pushing your changes to this branch, make sure youâ€™ve submitted your solutions to Advent of Code to collect your stars!
   - The leaderboard on the `main` branch updates based on your Advent of Code progress. If you push before earning your stars, they wonâ€™t reflect until the leaderboard is refreshed (every 30 minutes).

2. **Push to This Branch**:
   - Push your changes to this branch regularly to save your progress.
   - Ensure your code is complete and tested before pushing.


## Leaderboard Updates

The leaderboard displayed on the `main` branch will:
- Pull the latest data from Advent of Code periodically (every ~30 minutes).
- Update to show your progress based on the stars youâ€™ve earned.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: To ensure your stars appear on the leaderboard immediately, submit your solutions to Advent of Code before pushing your changes.
