## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent Calendar of coding puzzles, with a new challenge released every day from December 1st to December 12th. These puzzles are designed to hone your problem-solving abilities and provide an excellent opportunity to learn new coding techniques.

## How to Get Started

1. **Sign Up**  
   Visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/) and sign up.

2. **Join the Private Leaderboard**  
   Go tho the [Leaderboard page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private) and Enter our private leaderboard code: **353270-4499e43b**

3. **Set Up the Repository**  
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo_url>
     ```
   - Check out your personal branch (replace `your-branch-name` with your name i.e `joseph-pitts`):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```
   - Each participant will have their own branch. Please keep your solutions and notes in your branch to avoid conflicts with others.

4. **Log Your Progress**  
   Commit and push your solutions to your branch regularly. You can also share any thoughts, approaches, or challenges you faced for each day's puzzle.

## Repository Structure

- Each participant will have their own branch.
- Ensure your branch includes:
  - A folder for each day (e.g., `day01`, `day02`) containing your solution files.
  - Optionally, a `README.md` in each folder to document your approach or challenges for that day.


## Rules and Guidelines

- **Programming Language**: Use any language you prefer.
- **Collaboration**: Feel free to discuss strategies and techniques with the team. Sharing knowledge is encouraged!
- **No ChatGPT**: While Copilot autocomplete is allowed, using ChatGPT or similar tools to solve puzzles is prohibited.
- **Training Time**: You can log your time for solving these challenges under Training, but please keep it reasonable.
